 ## Filter Boundin Boxes
 In the Carla simulator, the generating of data sets with bounding box annotation suffers a problem where it does not take into account the objects that are obscured by obstructions as in the Image below.<br>
<img src="img/00004925.png"
         alt="img1"><br>
         bounding box before the filter<br>

And we called these boxes `Gohst boxes`.<br>
Our work in this project is to filter the boxes where they should be deleted.
We have implemented a Semantic segmentation camera in Carla Simulator to filter the boxes by comparing the color of image segmentation and the object in which it is detected. See the colors of image segmentation on Carla simulator [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref_sensors/#semantic-segmentation-camera).<br>
**In the Image below** we could find out our methodology to filter the boxes using the image segmentation sensor.
<img src="img/img03.png"
         alt="img03"><br>
         <strong>Figure 1:</strong> In this filter, we check each box in image segmentation
camera if it fulfills 10% of the color corresponding
to the object in image segmentation. In our example the
color of the car in image segmentation in Carla is (0, 0,
142), the small box behind the field is hidden and there is
no pixel with value (0, 0, 142) inside of it, as compared to
the bounding box for the car in the large box.<br>
<br><br>
### A significant portion of the bounding box
Our work also solved the problem of a significant portion of the bounding box when we generated our images in base of 2D bounding box and also solved the beam effect of boxes for negative notation of bounding g boxes as in the image below.<br>
<figure>
    <img src="img/img04.png"
             alt="img04"><br>
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The negative notation effects on the bounding
boxes for the objects. For 3D bounding box, the box appears
as a beam (left). For 2D bounding box (see the right
image), the box should have included the vehicle (in the
corner of the image at the right) inside, but instead, it is
covering a significant portion of the entire image.</figcaption>
</figure><br><br>
## Generate the Data
To create more flexible environments with various factors such as  a number of vehicles, pedestrians, and weather conditions, we developed our carlasimu package.<br>
You can control on these environmental elements through parameters defined in **YAML files**.<br>
While it is not intended just for data generation, it is also for developers, carlasimu is also useful for running custom environments tailored to your specific needs.<br>
Our project focuses on generating data from image sensors with annotations for 2D and 3D bounding boxes of six object categories: cars, buses, trucks, vans, pedestrians, and traffic lights. Additionally, the system can be extended to collect data from various sensor modalities, including Lidar, Radar, Depth Cameras, and semantic segmentation cameras.

</table><br>
<strong>- threshold_small_box</strong><br>
int: Default is 10: The default threshold for vehicle detection is set to 10%.<br>
This means that if at least 10% of the pixels within a designated box contain information about a vehicle, the system will consider it a valid detection and not filter it out.<br>
<strong>- size_big_box:</strong><br>
int: Default is 70: This value determines whether a box is considered "big." Boxes that occupy more than 70% of the entire image are filtered out in another threshold which is called  `threshold_big_box`, as they likely represent the entire scene rather than a specific object. **see the Figure 2**<br>
<strong>- threshold_big_box</strong><br>
int: Default is 50: The default threshold for vehicle detection is set to 50%.<br>
This means that if at least 50% of the pixels within a designated  **big box** contain information about a vehicle, the system will consider it a valid detection and not filter it out.<br>
<strong>- time_screen_shot</strong><br>
int: Default is 1: The default data saving interval is set to 1 second. This means that an image is captured and saved to the data set every second.<br>

## First Step
To implement your custom envinment in your carla simulator firstly you have to sit up your parameters in YAML files.<br>
Then lounch the Carla by duble click on the file `CarlaUE4.exe` for Windows, for Linux implement the following command<br>
```bash
cd /carla/root
./CarlaUE4.sh
```
The root folder should be inside the `Python API` folder in the Carla simulator [see the link](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_first_steps/).<br>
**See tutorial.py**
